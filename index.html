      <h2>Mt. Teneriffe</h2>
      <sub>June 2015</sub>
      
      <p>In June 2015 I hiked Mt. Teneriffe which is <strong>14 miles</strong> round trip and <i>4000ft elevation gain</i>. This summit is in the Snoqualmie Mountain Range and has a 360 view at the peak. It has one of the best views east of any of the peaks in this area, making it a great <b>sunrise hike</b>, which is actually how I first did this hike. We started at <u>1:45am</u> and summited around <u>4:30am</u>.</p>
